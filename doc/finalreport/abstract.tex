	\acf{AWESOME} is an open-source, web-based tool that enables departments to generate personalised questionnaires that are sent to students to gather feedback about modules.
	The aim of this project is to rewrite the \ac{AWESOME} prototype and have it replace existing methods of module evaluation in the Computer Science department at \acf{AU} by improving upon, and fixing problems with the existing module evaluation procedures.
