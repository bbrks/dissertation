Many thanks to my supervisor Hannah Dee for the guidance and support throughout this project; Sandy for providing a server, and support when it went wrong; and the rest of the staff at Aberystwyth University for the countless hours they put into making it an outstanding place to study.

Thanks to Gareth Williams for providing better Welsh translations than Google Translate ever could, and thanks Keiron O'Shea for the \acs{AWESOME} prototype upon which this project is based.

Thank you to my fellow classmates, flatmates, friends, and family for the continued motivation, ideas, and encouragement; not only over the past few months, but also the past four years through my university course.

But most of all thank you to Bethany Foskett, for being there with sugary snacks, caffeinated beverages, and occasionally being my rubber duck \cite{c2-rubber-ducking}.
