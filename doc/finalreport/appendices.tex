	These tests were carried out as part of acceptance testing using the submitted version of \ac{AWESOME}.
	Results are listed below.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test D8 fails as there is currently no safeguard in place for incorrect \ac{CSV} format.
		\item Test D12 fails as questionnaire respondent tokens aren't created until the moment of sending.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Both of these issues a quick fixes, but are unable to be implemented in time for the dissertation hand-in. They will be fixed in a future version.
