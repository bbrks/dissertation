	\chapter{User Feedback}
	\label{app:userfeedback}
	
	\begin{itemize}
\item Looks sleek and modern
\item This question needs to be at the end of the questionnaire. For CS12320 we need a "This lecturer did not teach me for this semester" option.
\item Can't compare it to the old one having never used it
\item The first question is a question about how much I like a new system I have yet to use properly this question should be last :P
\item It doesn't work properly for me on anything except an IS computer running Internet Explorer 9. The irony.
\item I don't remember/didn't use the old system
\item Difference not really noticeable using it, looks a deal nicer though.
\item Considering this is the first question you have asked me, it's a bit early to tell.
\item Very clean, much better than the last system. Nice job.
\item Much easier.
\item Half of the lecturers I'm asked about never taught me in the subjects.
\item Looking very nice, great to see that you've nearly finished. Tidy up that language selector though.
\item Looks nice and simple to use!
\item It would be nice if it was publicly accessible but I guess this is a beta.
\item Modules need to be more blocked off from each other, rather than just using headers.
\item I think this evaluation is great. It's personalised so we don't have to scroll through lot's of n/a modules. The layout is good, and the page doesn't seem endless (maybe that's because there's only 2 modules for me this year?). The only thing that might be worth adding is a little note to say if the feedback submitted will be anonymous. And maybe another box just to add any other comments on the department. I think maybe that's not included in the scope of this evaluation, but it would be nice to just be able to jot down any other feedback on the department as a whole. Apart from those two points, I think it's a massive improvement on the former system.
\item Looks pretty swish.
\item Seems like a huge improvement over the old system and very user friendly!
\item It's nice to have a personalised system rather than the usual generic one whereby a lecture is interrupted!
\item I really like the fact that the system automatically recognises my modules so that I don't have to manually find and select them.
\item The notification email could do with telling the user if the survey is confidential or not. Saying that its a personalised survey may suggest that the answers are logged against peoples user names and maybe reluctant to answer honestly.
\item FIX HTTPS PLEASE!!!

	\chapter{Test Tables}
	\label{app:testtables}
	
	These tests were carried out as part of acceptance testing using the submitted version of \ac{AWESOME}.
	Results are listed below.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test D8 fails as there is currently no safeguard in place for incorrect \ac{CSV} format.
		\item Test D12 fails as questionnaire respondent tokens aren't created until the moment of sending.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Both of these issues a quick fixes, but are unable to be implemented in time for the dissertation hand-in.
	They will be fixed in a future version.
